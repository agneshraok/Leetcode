<br>

## Description

<br>

## Solution

<br>

### Brute Force

- The following has $O()$ time complexity $O()$ space complexity.

  ```py

  ```

<br>

### Efficient Solution

- The following has $O(n)$ time complexity $O(1)$ space complexity.

  ```py
  class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        num_set = set(nums) #O(n)
        for num in num_set:
            if num-1 not in num_set:
                length = 1
                while num + length in num_set:
                    length += 1
                res = max(res, length)
        return res
  ```
  - This is not arguably O(n^2) algorithm, because the inner while loop runs only when the num is such that it can start a sequence, so for the other numbers of the sequence it won't be run.

<br>

### Ideal Solution

- The following has $O()$ time complexity $O()$ space complexity.

  ```py

  ```
